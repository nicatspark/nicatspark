## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Nicolas Hervy

I am sweden based and I've been doing web development since âœ¨1997âœ¨. That's when I programmed my first e-commerce site using Jscript and Netscapes JavaScript. Not long after that I did an online bank and so it continues. Lately I've started limiting my scope to purely front-end. My focus is writing maintainable code, CSS wispering and finding helpful coding patterns for large scale sites.


### Some of my customers 

...are or have been: 
- SKF, Internal applications (Frontend), 
- Scania Truck Configurator, Public site (Frontend/UX), 
- Scania Translation App, Internal application (Frontend), 
- Stena Renewable, Public site (Frontend/Backend/UX), 
- Volvo - ByggDinVolvo Car Configurator (Frontend), 
- Parans, CRM + public site (Frontend/Backend/UX), 
- Medivir, Public site (Frontend/Backend/UX), 
- Aktie-Ansvar Financial site (Frontend/Backend/UX), 
- Akelius Insurance - Bank (Frontend/Backend/UX)

Please, feel free to take anything you find interesting on my github and use it to your hearts content.


### Stuff I recommend:

...also look at miniStore, a 50-ish line small frontend global state manager.
