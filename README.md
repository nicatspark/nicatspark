### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Nicolas Hervy

I've been doing web development since âœ¨1997âœ¨. That when I programmed my first e-commerce site in Jscript and Netscapes JavaScript. Then I did an online bank and so it continues. Lately I've started limiting my scope to purely front-end. My focus is writing maintainable code, CSS wispering and finding helpful coding patterns for large scale sites.

Please, feel free to take anything you find interesting here and use it to your hearts content.
